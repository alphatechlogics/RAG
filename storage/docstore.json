Decision trees use a branching\nsequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of\nthe advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit,\nunlike the black box of the neural network.\nRandom forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a\nvalue or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm\ntype\u2014supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\u2014has its own\nadvantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both\npredicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories.\nDecision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented\nwith a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to\nvalidate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more\nunstable than other decision predictors.\nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage\nfor new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in\nmassive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires\nlittle human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning\nsystem assemble and refine its own algorithms\u2014which will continually improve with\nmore data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized\nexperience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.\nOn the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate\nand unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering\nsufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on\nresources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With\ntoo small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is\ncompletely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers,\norganizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the\noutput.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9437, "end_char_idx": 11921, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "909cf99a-4f63-489f-952e-168ba361560c": {"__data__": {"id_": "909cf99a-4f63-489f-952e-168ba361560c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/kheem/Desktop/Alpha/RAG/RAG/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2025-03-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fceedb77-d55e-4214-8d7e-af7fab1f54fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/kheem/Desktop/Alpha/RAG/RAG/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2025-03-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-01"}, "hash": "9f34fb2ff6b3c199780ed866167e9b9d34ab799887fc14647d3bc86b70d2c13c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e01141a0-bde9-416c-a5a9-8e07fe9bccc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/kheem/Desktop/Alpha/RAG/RAG/Data/MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 21968, "creation_date": "2025-03-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-01"}, "hash": "722bcbc34e327ceabde410e62769a750bba8bbf948f8eb4e690c4cd0c6795469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "01ef5c6c-538d-4457-b4ad-2e46bec445ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cce89589da13a1547e3e42a7b63d6ec94f94af2ff8115fb46c651b3e47d3a916", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Real-world machine learning use cases\nHere are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\nSpeech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer\nspeech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format.

Should\nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to\nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,\nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI\ntechnology develops.\nAI impact on jobs\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\nthat the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away,\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas.

There will still need to be people\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service.
